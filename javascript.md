# JavaScript

## 0) Initialize an NPM package in this folder

 -  create `.gitignore` file for `node_modules` directory
 -  save your dependencies to the `package.json` file

## 1) Green Fox Notebook Error Reporter

Build a webapp that people can use to report technical issues.

### Frontend

The application consists of two screens.

#### Home (index.html)

![home](assets/corsac-ori-form-js.png)

It is built up from:

 -  a navigation bar, with a link to the tickets screen
 -  a heading with the title of the page
 -  a form to register a ticket
     -  dropdown list with all the names from the database
     -  input field to set the manufacturer
     -  input field to set the serial number
     -  textarea to set the description
     -  a REPORT button which should start an AJAX call to the `/tickets` endpoint with the form data

#### Tickets (tickets.html)

![list example](assets/corsac-ori-list-js.png)

It is built up from:

 -  a navigation bar, with a link to the home screen
 -  a heading with the title of the page
 -  a table to display all the tickets from the database
     -  in the last column you should render a delete button which will remove the ticket permanently (also from the database)

### Backend

The backend should handle all the ticket related http requests and serve the static content to the application.

#### Static content

All the static files should be served from a dedicated folder (eg.: public, client, etc...)

#### Endpoints

##### GET `/users`

This endpoint is used to list all the available users

Example query:

[GET] `http://localhost:8080/users`

 -  this should return a json with the users collected from the database

```json
{
    "users":
    [
        {
            "id" : 1,
            "name" : "Egg"
        },
        {
            "id" : 2,
            "name" : "Tom"
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

##### GET `/tickets`

This endpoint should be responsible to list the tickets from the database.

 -  if there is no query parameter, the backend must send all the tickets
 -  if there is a manufacturer query parameter, the backend must filter only the tickets with the given manufacturer
 -  if there is a reporter query parameter, the backend must filter only the the tickets which are reported by the given user
 -  the manufacturer and reporter query parameters can be mixed
 -  it's okay to return the reported id instead of the reporter name (of course it will take some points from you)

Example query:

[GET] `http://localhost:8080/tickets?manufacturer=dell`

 -  this should return a json with every ticket where the manufacturer is "dell"

```json
{
    "tickets":
    [
        {
            "id" : 21,
            "reporter" : "Egg",
            "manufacturer" : "dell",
            "serial_number" : 123456789,
            "description" : "screen pixel error",
            "reported_at" : "2018-01-10T23:00:00.000Z"
        },
        {
            "id" : 27,
            "reporter" : "Brian",
            "manufacturer" : "dell",
            "serial_number" : 987654321,
            "description" : "touchpad is not working",
            "reported_at" : "2018-01-17T23:00:00.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

[GET] `http://localhost:8080/tickets?reporter=1`

 -  this should return a json with every ticket where the reporter's id is 1


[GET] `http://localhost:8080/tickets`

 -  this should return a json with all the tickets from the database

##### POST `/tickets`

This endpoint should:

 -  validate the sent data according to the following rules:
     -  reporter is a number
     -  manufacturer is set
     -  serial number is set
     -  description is set
 -  supplement the ticket with the current date
 -  save the ticket into database
 -  set the status code to 400 if the validation failed
 -  set the status code to 500 if any database error has occured

Example query:

[POST] `http://localhost:8080/tickets`

This should be the request's body:

```json
{
    "reporter": 1,
    "manufacturer": "dell",
    "serial_number": 123481639,
    "description": "keyboard is not working"
}
```

 -  this should return a json with the newly created ticket
 -  if you feel the power you can return the reporter name instead of the id

```json
{
    "id" : 22,
    "reporter": 1,
    "manufacturer": "dell",
    "serial_number": 123481639,
    "description": "keyboard is not working",
    "reported_at" : "2018-01-18T23:00:00.000Z"
}
```

##### DELETE `/tickets/:id`

It deletes the specified ticket if the request's header contains the Authorization `HTTP header` with the value of 'voala'. The endpoint should:

 -  validate the header
     -  if authorization header is missing it should return an empty response with a 401 status code
 -  delete the ticket from the database
 -  return an empty response with a 204 status code
 -  return an empty response with a 500 status code if any error has occured

Example query:

[DELETE] `http://localhost:8080/tickets/12`

 -  this should return an empty response, with a 204 status code

## 2) Question time

### a, What's the difference between Array.prototype.forEach and Array.prototype.map?
Map iterates through the array and does the required function(transforms
the array), and comes
back with a new array which has the same length as the original one.

forEach also iterates through the arrayand does the function we want on it,
but it doesnt transform the array;


### b, Write an example usage of the map and forEach function.
//Psuedo Code//
const a = [1,2,3,4];

let double = a.map(((e) => e*2));
console.log(double) ==> [2,4,6,8]

The example usage here is that I wanted the store the new values in a new array

let logDouble = a.mforEach((e) => console.log(e*2))  ==> [2,4,6,8]

The example usage here is that I wanted to logg the values
